uniqueSteps.py: Python program to calculate number of unique ways to climb N stairs
given that you can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time

# Function args #
#################
# N : number of stairs

# Return value #
################
# returns an integer

    # For other values of n 
    # we iterate over array to calculate number of ways at current step
    # by summing number of ways to climb previous one or two steps
    # which covers all possible ways to reach current step
